                To start using the application you only need to enter the website, create a group page and invite all the group members into the group room. Each member of the group sets what he would and would not like to do in the trip and after everyone has finished entering his requirements TripUs will analyze everybodyâ€™s requests and recommend the best locations for the trip based on it.</h3>
